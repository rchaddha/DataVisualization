DataVis'21 Project 1

This project introduces you to the basics of using D3 to create and transform
SVGs that visualize some given data. Start by running a local webserver to
serve this directory, which contains your own copy of d3.v6.js (no external
network connection is needed).  You should then read through index.html to get
a sense of what it is trying to do, and then start your work by completing
functions inside p1.js.  The more you complete, the more visualizations you'll
see.  You can look at p1-soln.html (e.g. at http://localhost:8000/p1-soln.html)
to get a static view of how the solution code creates the SVGs on the page,
including the ability to inspect the anatomy of the SVGs.

p1.js is the only file you should svn commit your changes to.  Grading will
use the originally distributed versions of all the other files, as well as some
modifications of index.html to ensure that your results are not hard-coded.

You too may want to modify how index.html generates the data to confirm for
yourself that your code can do more than look at 9 linearly increasing data
values: around line 43 you can change the data value range, the number of data
values, and the last "false" argument to util.dataGen() can be changed to
"true" to get random values that change with each reload.
